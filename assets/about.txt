I am a postgraduate in Artificial Intelligence (MSc) with a background in Computer Networking and IT Security (BSc). I have a strong foundation in computer science and hands-on experience across machine learning, deep learning, and software development. During my academic journey, I worked on impactful projects including a sign language–to–speech glove, which combined sensors and machine learning to translate hand gestures into audible speech, and a single-image AI system for monocular depth estimation and 3D model reconstruction using neural networks and Structure from Motion, developed as part of my Master’s dissertation. 
Alongside my academic work, I have 1+ years of professional experience as a Java Developer at FocusOne Pvt Ltd, a fintech company, where I contributed to building and maintaining scalable backend systems. I enjoy working at the intersection of intelligent systems and real-world applications, continuously building projects, exploring emerging AI technologies, and refining my skills to create practical, high-impact solutions.
